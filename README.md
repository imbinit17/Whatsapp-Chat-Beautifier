<h2>How to use in case of Personal Chats ?</h2>

The txt file is usually in the format of : 
```
12/12/23, 8:03â€¯pm - Person1: Hey
12/12/23, 8:04â€¯pm - Person2: Hello
12/12/23, 8:04â€¯pm - Person1: How r u buddy ?? 
12/12/23, 8:04â€¯pm - Person2: Just fine.... wanna hangout tomorrow ??
12/12/23, 8:04â€¯pm - Person1: Done...
```


In such a scenario , an interface is possible for both 'Person1' and 'Person2' from the exported file . Hence , the user without making any mistakes is required to write the name in whose screen of view the chats are to be viewed on the webpage .

<h2>How to use in case of Group Chats ?</h2>

The txt file is usually in the format of : 
```
12/12/23, 8:03â€¯pm - Person1: Hey
12/12/23, 8:04â€¯pm - Person2: Hello
12/12/23, 8:04â€¯pm - Person3: How r u buddy ?? 
12/12/23, 8:04â€¯pm - Person4: Just fine.... wanna hangout tomorrow ??
12/12/23, 8:04â€¯pm - Person1: Done...
```


In such a scenario , an interface is possible for both 'Person1' to 'Person4' ,therefore from whose perspective the chat is to be viewed must be stated explicitly without mistakes (case sensitive) .

In both the scenarios , if a name is typed which doesn't match any name exactly (case sensitive) from the exported text file , there will be no messages from the sender's perspective i,e, you .

<h2>About Images</h2>

If there are N number of people such that Person1 ,Person2....PersonN .

Then for images to appear in the webpage , they must be present in the directory with the corresponding names of Person1,Person2,etc . If not present , the default image of "default.jpg" will replace their profile pictures in the webpage .
