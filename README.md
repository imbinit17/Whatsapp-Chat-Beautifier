## PROCEDURE :
0. Open the link from above
1. Export your whatsapp chat (personal or group chat) with media in form of a zip and extract it to a desired location
2. On clicking "Select Media" , select all the media except the "txt" file from the extracted zip and open
3. Then clicking "Select Chat File" , select the "txt" file
4. Write the name without any mistakes (case sensitive) of whose view the chat is desired i.e your name is "Person 1" in the txt file ,then write "Person 1"
5. Let it load completely with the images and videos (it may take a few mins)
6. Save the webpage in your desired location (Ctrl+S)

## How to make sure profile photo is visible ?
When selecting media , insert images of profile pics with corresponding names from the "txt" file 

Suppose , in a Group chat , there are 4 people : 
1. You : "Binit"
2. Person 1 : "Aditya Bhai"
3. Person 2 : "Akshay Developer"
4. Person 3 : "Ranjeet Whatsapp"

Now while selecting media , if images "Binit" ,"Aditya Bhai" ,"Akshay Developer", "Ranjeet Whatsapp" (case sensitive) are inserted , 
they would be displayed to their corresponding names instead of 'default.jpg'

## NOTE :
1. Do it on a computer
2. Try to keep the profile pic uploaded in a NxN form (square) rather than a LxB form (rectangle)
